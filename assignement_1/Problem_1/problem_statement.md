# Problem 1:

## Problem Setting:

You are an assistant to the king, who has scheduled a party tomorrow. There are
1000 wine bottles in the king&#39;s possession, and unfortunately, 3 of them are
poisonous. Consuming from any of these bottles will result in death the following
day.
Your task is to identify the 3 poisonous bottles by tomorrow morning to ensure
the safety of all the guests.

## Possible Solution:

You have the option to use prisoners to help you in this endeavor. One possible
approach is to assign each of the 1000 prisoners to drink from a different bottle.
By observing the 3 prisoners who die the next day, you can determine which
bottles are poisonous.

## Objective:

However, your challenge is to find a solution that uses the fewest
number of prisoners possible to achieve this objective.
We request you to create a document outlining your solution and explaining
the algorithm you have developed for this task.
