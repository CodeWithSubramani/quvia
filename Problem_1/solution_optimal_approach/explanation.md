# Poison Bottle Detection: Optimized Binary Encoding Approach

## üöÄ The Optimized Solution for Large-Scale Detection

This guide explains the efficient method for detecting multiple poisoned bottles among thousands (or even millions) of bottles using binary encoding.

## üîç Core Idea: Binary Encoding of Bottle IDs

### üìä Key Improvements Over Brute-Force

1. **No Combinatorial Explosion** - Doesn't generate all possible combinations
2. **Logarithmic Scaling** - Handles millions of bottles efficiently
3. **Direct Bit Manipulation** - Uses binary representations for fast computation

## üß© How It Works (Single Poisoned Bottle)

### üè∑Ô∏è Assigning Binary IDs to Bottles

Each bottle gets a unique binary ID with `ceil(log‚ÇÇN)` bits:

**Example: 1000 Bottles (N=1000)**
- Bits needed: `ceil(log‚ÇÇ1000) = 10`
- Bottle #19 ‚Üí `0000010011` (binary of 19 in 10 bits)

### üë• Prisoner Strategy

- **Each prisoner represents one bit position**
- Prisoner drinks from bottles where their bit is `1`

| Prisoner | Tests Bit Position |
|----------|--------------------|
| P1       | Bit 1 (LSB)        |
| P2       | Bit 2              |
| ...      | ...                |
| P10      | Bit 10 (MSB)       |

### üîç Identifying the Poison

Dead prisoners reveal `1` bits:
- If P1, P2, P5 die ‚Üí `0000110001` ‚Üí Bottle 19+16+2+1 = **Bottle 38**

## üß™ Handling Multiple Poisons (K > 1)

### üî¢ The Clever Encoding

1. **Encode each poisoned bottle separately**
2. **Concatenate their binary representations**
3. **Assign prisoners to bit positions in the combined string**

**Formula:**
```
Prisoners needed = K √ó ceil(log‚ÇÇN)
```

### üìù Step-by-Step Process

1. **Calculate bits per bottle**: `bits = ceil(log‚ÇÇ(total_bottles))`
2. **Encode each poison bottle** in binary
3. **Concatenate all binary strings**
4. **Assign prisoners** to test each bit

**Example: 1000 Bottles, 2 Poisons (Bottles 19 & 439)**
- Bits per bottle: 10
- Encodings:
  - 19 ‚Üí `000010011`
  - 439 ‚Üí `0110110111`
- Combined: `0000100110110110111` (20 bits ‚Üí 20 prisoners)

## ‚ö° Why This Scales Beautifully

| Bottles (N) | Poisons (K) | Brute-Force Prisoners | Optimized Prisoners |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| 1,000       | 1           | 10                    | 10                  |
| 1,000       | 2           | 17                    | 20                  |
| 1,000,000   | 3           | 60                    | 60                  |
| 2¬≤‚Å∞         | 5           | 100                   | 100                 |

**Key Advantage**: Linear growth with K rather than combinatorial explosion!

## üíª Python Implementation Highlights

```python
def detect_poison_bottles(self, poison_list):
    bits_per_bottle = math.ceil(math.log2(self.total_bottles))
    
    # Encode all poisons in binary and concatenate
    full_binary = ''.join(
        bin(bottle)[2:].zfill(bits_per_bottle)
        for bottle in sorted(poison_list)
    )
    
    # Each prisoner tests one bit
    prisoners_needed = len(full_binary)
    
    # Decode back to bottle numbers
    identified = [
        int(full_binary[i:i+bits_per_bottle], 2)
        for i in range(0, len(full_binary), bits_per_bottle)
    ]
```

## üéØ When To Use This Method

‚úÖ **Best for**:
- Large N (thousands to millions of bottles)
- Moderate K (typically < 10 poisons)
- When memory efficiency matters

‚ùå **Less ideal for**:
- Very small N (under 100 bottles)
- When K approaches N/2 (though still better than brute-force)

## üåü Final Thoughts

This optimized approach transforms an exponentially complex problem into a manageable linear one by:
1. Leveraging binary encoding
2. Avoiding combination generation
3. Providing deterministic results

The solution maintains perfect accuracy while being feasible for real-world scale problems!
